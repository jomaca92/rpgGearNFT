# rpgLoot NFT Collection

This is the minting interface for an NFT collection of randomly generated RPG Gear - inspired by the [Loot (for Adventurers)](https://www.lootproject.com/) collection and built based on the Buildspace NFT Collection project.

The contract "randomly" generates and stores all data on chain at the time of minting. It can mint up to 5 pieces in one transaction, and has a total supply modifiable by the contract owner. You can view the Solidity smart contract [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xb06621eFCf914fee8595ac7BCf8DF06B4F6a4b0E).
